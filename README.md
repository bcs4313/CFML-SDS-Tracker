# SDS Tracker

A Safety Data Sheet (SDS) management application for tracking chemical inventory and GHS hazard records.

---

## Tech Stack

- **CFML** on Lucee (Adobe CF compatible)
- **H2** embedded relational database
- **Hibernate ORM** (Lucee built-in) — `dbcreate: update`
- **Bootstrap 5.3** for styling
- **REST API** with Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0 documentation
- **Layered architecture** — API handler → Service → DAO → ORM Model

## REST API

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:4929`  
Full spec: `public/api.yaml` — viewable via `/ui/swagger.cfm`

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/rest/api/chemicals/getall` | List all chemicals |
| POST | `/rest/api/chemicals/create` | Create a chemical |
| DELETE | `/rest/api/chemicals/delete` | Delete a chemical by ID |
| GET | `/rest/api/hazards/getall` | List all hazards |
| POST | `/rest/api/hazards/create` | Create a hazard |
| DELETE | `/rest/api/hazards/delete` | Delete a hazard by ID |

POST bodies are `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. DELETE bodies send the numeric ID as plain text.

## Getting Started

Requires [CommandBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox).

```bash
box start
```

Server config is in `server.json`. The H2 database file is created automatically on first run via `dbcreate: update`.

The datasource `sdstracker` must be configured in Lucee admin or auto-provisioned by CommandBox before the application starts.

## Architecture Notes

**Singleton pattern** — services, DAOs, and utilities are instantiated once in `onApplicationStart()` and stored on the `application` scope.

**Form handling** — POST requests from HTML forms arrive as URL-encoded strings. `FormDataHandler.cfc` converts them to JSON before the service layer deserializes them.

**CAS validation** — `CasNumberValidator.cfc` implements the CAS checksum algorithm. The same logic is duplicated client-side in `createChemical.cfm` for immediate user feedback.

**Header search** — the sitewide search form in `header.cfm` is wired to dashboard search on `index.cfm` via `initHeaderSearch()`. It filters the in-memory data cache loaded by `loadDashboard()` — no additional API calls.
